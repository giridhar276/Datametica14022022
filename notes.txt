** Everything in Python is Object **
** Every object contains set of methods ***

number
------
number can be integer or decimal or octal or hexadecimal.

val = 45
aval = 56.4


string
------
string is defined in single or double or triple quotes.

aname = "python programming"
bname = 'unix shell'
cname = """scala programming"""


list
----
list contains set of elements.
Elements can be numbers or strings or any combination.
list elements are defined in []

alist = [10,20,30,40]
blist = [45.43,45.3,78.7]
clist = [10,"unix","java",56.5]


tuple ( immutable , unchangable  , uneditable , readonly )
------
tuple contains set of elements.
Elements can be numbers or strings or any combination.
tuple elements are defined in ().
**** Elements INSIDE TUPLE cannot be modified  DIRECTLY *****

atup = ("unix","java",56,56.545)


dictionary
-------------
In dictionary , elements are defined in key:value pairs
Indexing is not allowed in dictionary
In dictionary,
          key is string or number which is used to uniquely identify the value
          value can be number or string or list or tuple or dictionary.

syntax:    object = {key:value , key:value ..... }
example:     book = {"chap1":10 ,"chap2":20 }
              info= {1:2,3:4,5:6}
              data = {"chap1":[10,"UK","Rita"] ,"chap2":[20,"US","Mary"] }


set
------
set is UNORDERED collection of UNIQUE elements of SAME type.

aset = {10,10,10,20,30,40}
